📊 Advanced Ecommerce Sales Dashboard
I designed an Ecommerce Sales Dashboard leveraging field parameters, buttons, bookmarks, line charts, bar charts, clustered column charts, and stacked column charts to enhance interactivity and data-driven decision-making.

🔹 Key Features:
✔️ Dynamic field parameters for flexible data selection
✔️ Interactive buttons and bookmarks for seamless navigation
✔️ Various chart types for comprehensive data visualization
✔️ BookMarks implementation with Show/Hide effects of slicers

This dashboard enables insightful analysis of sales trends, helping businesses optimize their performance. 🚀
